# TomFolio2: using Vite create with Lit3

This is the project you get when you run `npm create vite@latest`.

I followed the setup guide here: https://vite.dev/guide/

Currently need to run nvm use 20 when I open a new terminal (likely can be solved by adding something to bash profile? But I'm lazy..)

## Dev

To develop, run

`npm run dev`

## Build

`npm run build`

## Deployment

Tomfolio2 is hosted on a Digital Ocean App.

This is hooked up to the `main` branch of your Github repo and will deploy any commits pushed to this branch.
