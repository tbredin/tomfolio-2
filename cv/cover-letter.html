            Hi, my name is Tom, I&#39;m a Front End Developer, Accessibility Specialist, and Design Engineer based in
            Melbourne. I have recently wrapped up a 2.5 year contract and am looking for something new, starting
            Oct/Nov/Dec.

            More about me — I&#39;m a kiwi who came to Melbourne in 2014, currently residing in the lovely city of
            Merri-Bek. My background is in both design and development. I studied a hybrid Computer Graphic Design
            degree back in the mid 2000s. I&#39;ve spoken at MelbCSS, A11yBytes Melbourne, DesignOps Melbourne, and
            A11yCamp Sydney, on topics such as web typography, accessibility testing approaches, and design systems
            collaboration. Back in 2016 I released the MegaType vertical rhythm system which made waves in the web
            typography community and promoted renewed discussion about support for typographic units on the web (such as
            cap-height or x-height), and promoting early discussion of other forward thinking web typography features,
            like leading-trim.

            Design systems and reusable components have been a big career focus of mine. In my last role as Senior
            Design Systems Engineer I was leading a component library project with some unique challenges like code
            sharing across multiple websites and across some pockets of legacy code as well. I take a very tech-agnostic
            approach, with a belief that a different technology stack will suit the unique needs and skills of each team
            and project. For this component library I led a tech research sprint and open RFC process with the team,
            opting for web components using Lit 3 due to their impressive interoperability and performance
            characteristics.

            I&#39;ve led the tech on a lot of design systems projects over the years, including Department of Health and
            Human Services Intranet (internal system, a client we had at Today), WorkSafe Victoria&#39;s component
            library (client at Today), or Merri-Bek City Council&#39;s component library (Liquorice client).

            Browser performance — I can assess rendering with confidence. One recent performance-focused project I led
            was the front end for the ACMI Story Of the Moving Image Online Exhibition while working at Liquorice —
            where we needed to optimise rendering of very very long web pages with a lot of media on them. We also had
            animations on these pages that needed to be well optimised and smooth at 60fps. Both of these challenges
            required attention given to browser rendering — profiling scroll perf, paint flashes and compositing to
            ensure the GPU is not doing unnecessary work and optimising where we could to reduce render load.

            Accessibility excellence is also a core part of what I do, where I aim to comfortably surpass WCAG 2.2 AA
            with everything I do. Accessibility is a practice, which requires years of industry experience and a
            discerning eye to do it well — inclusive design truly cannot be reduced to a simple checklist. I combine
            automated and manual testing approaches which ensure we do not leave anyone behind.

            I would love to talk more about opportunities at COMPANY. Ask me about my personal site — which is also a
            tech demo of a number of technologies I&#39;m excited about, from web components to vertical rhythm to user
            preferences and themes.
